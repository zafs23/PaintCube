    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('api/user/', include('user.urls')),

    # django by default serves any static files but does not serve any media
    # file by default
] + static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)  # makes
# the media URL available in the development server thus we can test images
# without having to set up a web server for serving these media files
